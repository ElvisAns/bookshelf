# @TODO: General Instructions
#   - As you're creating endpoints, define them and then search for 'TODO' within the frontend to update the endpoints there.
#     If you do not update the endpoints, the lab will not work - of no fault of your API code!
#   - Make sure for each route that you're thinking through when to abort and with which kind of error
#   - If you change any of the response body keys, make sure you update the frontend to correspond.

    # @TODO: Write a route that retrivies all books, paginated.
    #         You can use the constant above to paginate by eight books.
    #         If you decide to change the number of books per page,
    #         update the frontend to handle additional books in the styling and pagination
    #         Response body keys: 'success', 'books' and 'total_books'
    # TEST: When completed, the webpage will display books including title, author, and rating shown as stars

    # @TODO: Write a route that will update a single book's rating.
    #         It should only be able to update the rating, not the entire representation

    # @TODO: Write a route that will delete a single book.
    #        Response body keys: 'success', 'deleted'(id of deleted book), 'books' and 'total_books'
    #        Response body keys: 'success', 'books' and 'total_books'

    # TEST: When completed, you will be able to delete a single book by clicking on the trashcan.

    # @TODO: Write a route that create a new book.
    #        Response body keys: 'success', 'created'(id of created book), 'books' and 'total_books'
    # TEST: When completed, you will be able to a new book using the form. Try doing so from the last page of books.
    #       Your new book should show up immediately after you submit it at the end of the page.
